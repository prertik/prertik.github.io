This is week was awesome. Though there were some difficulties due to electricity cuts, cool improvements were made to the previous patch series. The patch series I&rsquo;m working on hit a milestone.

<p>Hello Everyone.</p>
<p>This is week was awesome. Though there were some difficulties due to electricity cuts, cool improvements were made to the previous patch series. The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/pull/505" target="_blank">patch series</a> I&rsquo;m working on hit a milestone. Now, it can perform a real rebase. Of course, the environment variables are kept default and this might introduce bugs but for development purposes; to see real development, this is one amazing way. There was also some work on refactoring out codes from <code>sequencer.c</code> to <code>checkout.c</code> so that the codes can be used from our builtin rebase. So, after refactoring, a bug got introduced due to improper locking. This issue was fixed in [this commit] (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/pull/505/commits/b58689f0cce89525e5a985122213c077b8926862%29" target="_blank">https://github.com/git/git/pull/505/commits/b58689f0cce89525e5a985122213c077b8926862)</a>. This patch series might debut in the mailing list in the coming days.</p>
<p>You can test the patch using the same technique mentioned in previous blog post.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more.</p>
